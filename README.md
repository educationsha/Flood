## Flood prediction Algorithm

Flood detection and localization are critical in real-time image processing for applications like autonomous navigation, surveillance, and AI-driven content extraction. However, traditional models like YOLOv5 often fail to generate accurate thumbnails due to misaligned bounding boxes, even when Floods are correctly identified. To address this, we present the Sha Rotation Thumbnail Algorithm (FLOOD), which enhances alignment and orientation by rotating detected Floods at 0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, and 270¬∞. This approach ensures precise thumbnail generation, even for skewed or rotated Floods.
